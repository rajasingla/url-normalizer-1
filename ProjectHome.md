URL Normalizer is the name of URL Normalization or URL canonicalization in this project.Then, it decides if two syntactially different URLs are equivalent.

It could avoid that web crawler crawling the same content in different URLs.
The detail of URL Normalization and it's algorithm where you could study via this link below.

My implementation is based on Wikipedia but normalization based on URL lists is not done yet which is the process of detecting different URLs with similar text via URL not his content automatically.

It is a static library for all of the search engine and web crawler. If you have any suggestion or bug reports,
contacting to me via jiayunye@gmail.com.
Thanks!Enjoy it.
